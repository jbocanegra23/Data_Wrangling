# Data_Wrangling

A couple different ways of wrangling data. 

File: previous_contacts: this is to tag all members of a household if the business reason requires that - for instance - if a member of a universe gives a response, then we want to tag the whole household for simplification.

File: file splitting: At times, there is a business reason to export from the parent db different excel / csv files based on a certain characteristic - such as geography. This function is a way to automate this process.
